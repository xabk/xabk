Hey, I'm Alex, Localization Lead at Coffee Stain Publishing

I've got over 15 years of experience in the industry: as a video games translator, 
localization PM, lead PM, and even sales manager. Now I'm taking care of localization
and integrations for most of our games.

- I’m interested in localization, and how it works in UE and Unity
- I’m currently learning UE, Unity, JS (for Google Apps Script), and a bit more Python
- I’m looking to collaborate on UE and Unity localization and text improvements,
  sync scripts, and loc tools
